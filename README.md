# Ruby environments

This extension provides Ruby environment management for VS Code, providing ways for detecting the Ruby interpreter in the
user's machine with integrations to version managers. It is intended to be used as a dependency of other extensions that
need to activate the Ruby environment in order to launch Ruby executables, such as the
[Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) and [Ruby debug](https://github.com/ruby/vscode-rdbg).
